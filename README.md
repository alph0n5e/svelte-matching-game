# Svelte Matching Game

Matching Game using Svelte.

Based on the video tutorial ["Learn Svelte By Making A Matching Game"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2q9caYXgkg&ab_channel=JoyofCode) by [JoyofCode](https://www.youtube.com/@JoyofCodeDev) on YouTube.

I made the following improvements:
- Split code into Svelte components,
- Add global state management with `svelte/store`,
- Add user-set Theme & Difficulty game settings,
